Koans get you a fairly long way


[Clojure for the brave and true](http://www.braveclojure.com/) is a book that
is good for people with some programming experience: starts with setting up Emacs. It is available to read for
[free online](http://www.braveclojure.com/introduction/). The tone is light and fun
and it doesn't belabor the differences between FP and OOP.

[ClojureBridge](http://www.clojurebridge.org/) events are aimed at increasing participation by people from under-represented
groups. However, the [curriculum and resources are available for free GitHub](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/curriculum).

[Clojure Cookbook](http://clojure-cookbook.com/) is full of real-world examples that you can copy but that doesn't make it good resource for learning the language from scratch.

[Clojure in action](https://www.manning.com/books/clojure-in-action) starts fine but gets pretty macro heavy very quickly. Perhaps best if you already know something about FP.

## Apps
There is a REPL-app for [android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sattvik.clojure_repl&hl=en_GB) so you can code on the bus.

## Good libraries to browse on GitHub
