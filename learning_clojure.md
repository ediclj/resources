# Books

- [Clojure For The Brave And True](http://www.braveclojure.com/): 
   -  great beginners guide, presented in a playful style.
   -  good for people with some programming experience: starts with setting up Emacs. It is available to read for [free online](http://www.braveclojure.com/introduction/). The tone is light and fun and it doesn''t belabor the differences between FP and OOP.
- [Programming Clojure](https://pragprog.com/book/shcloj2/programming-clojure): excellent general guide to clojure, presumes some programming experience.
- [Clojure Cookbook](http://clojure-cookbook.com/): good for users who already know clojure and want to learn more advanced techniques.
- [Functional Programming for the Object Oriented Programmer](https://leanpub.com/fp-oo)
- [Clojure Cookbook](http://clojure-cookbook.com/) is full of real-world examples that you can copy but that doesn''t make it good resource for learning the language from scratch.
[Clojure in action](https://www.manning.com/books/clojure-in-action) starts fine but gets pretty macro heavy very quickly. Perhaps best if you already know something about FP.

[ClojureBridge](http://www.clojurebridge.org/) events are aimed at increasing participation by people from under-represented groups. However, the [curriculum and resources are available for free GitHub](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/curriculum).

#Tool Up!

[Getting a "nice" Emacs setup](https://github.com/overtone/emacs-live)
[Getting Emacs + Paredit + iTerm2 to work OSX](http://offbytwo.com/2012/01/15/emacs-plus-paredit-under-terminal.html) I would also goto your OSX Keyboard shortcuts and un-tick all the keyboard shortcuts and under iTerm Preferences -> Keys delete all the shortcuts

## Apps
There is a REPL-app for [android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sattvik.clojure_repl&hl=en_GB) so you can code on the bus.
